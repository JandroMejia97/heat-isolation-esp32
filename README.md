# ESP-32s Project with Arduino and PlatformIO

This project consists of an ESP-32s that uses Arduino libraries to read the temperature and humidity of the environment and the temperature of an object. The ESP-32s has a web server that allows you to control a relay that is connected to a heating element.

## Before start

Before compiling the project, you must create a file named *credentials.h* in the *http_server* folder with the following defined macros:

```c++
#define AP_SSID_SECRETS "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
#define AP_PASSWORD_SECRETS "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
#define AP_HOSTNAME_SECRETS "YOUR_HOSTNAME"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to replace the example values with your own data before compiling.

## Compiling and uploading

To compile and upload the project to the ESP-32s, you must have PlatformIO installed. If you don't have it, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).

Once you have PlatformIO installed, you have build the file system image and upload it to the ESP-32s. To do this, you must follow the third step in the [official documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#uploading-files-to-file-system).

After that, you can compile and upload the project to the ESP-32s by clicking on the *Upload* button on the PlatformIO toolbar.

> [!NOTE]
> Before uploading the project, make sure that you have all the libraries installed. You can install them by clicking on the *Libraries* button on the PlatformIO toolbar and searching for the library name. Or you can download them from the [libraries](#libraries) section.

## Hardware

The following hardware is used in this project:

* ESP-32s
* MLX90614
* DHT11
* Relay
* Resistor 15W 1.2Î©J

## Compile for Arduino IDE

To compile the project for Arduino IDE, you must run the following command:

```bash
source ./make-arduino.sh
```

This command will ask you for the version of the project that you want to assign to the output folder. The output folder will be named *build/heat-[version]*.
